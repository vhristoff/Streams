# Streams

Using only Streams, Lambdas, and Method references complete the tasks defined in the main class. 

Each of the domain objects (Product, Order, Customer) has getAll() method which can be used as source for the Stream operations. There is no actual data returned so if you want to test with some data you can create another source.
